# Gold-Coins

## Problem Statement
We have ​*n* ​gold coins out of which some coins are fake and the rest are
genuine. The number of genuine coins is strictly greater than the number of fake
coins. Coins of the same type have the same weight. We have a balance using
which we can test if two coins have the same weight.

The problem is to find a genuine coin using as few weighings as possible. A
trivial algorithm to solve the problem is to pick one coin and test it with every other
coin. This uses ​*n-1*​ weighings. We want something slightly better. Design an
algorithm that finds a genuine coin in ​*n-B(n)* weighings, where ​*B(n)* denotes the
number of 1s in the binary representation of ​*n*.
